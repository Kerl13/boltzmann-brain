Boltzmann Brain
---------------

*Boltzmann Brain* is a Haskell-based library and combinatorial system
sampler compiler [1]. Using an easy and intuitive context-free text input representing 
a combinatorial system of rational or algebraic structures, *Boltzmann Brain* constructs 
a working, self-contained Haskell module implementing a dedicated
singular,  rejection-based Boltzmann sampler [2].

#### How to install

*Boltzmann brain* requires several pre-installed tools.
 * The tuning part requires `python2`. If you don't have it, visit [this
   page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
 * Within `python2` several additional packages should be installed. Normally
   when you launch the code, it tells you the exact list if some package is
missing. In order to install the packages, type into the command line
 ```
 pip2 install cvxpy numpy sympy matplotlib
 ```
 Note that the last three packages come by default with [Scientific Computing
Tools for Python](https://www.scipy.org/about.html)
 * The compiling and sampling part require `Haskell`. We recommend to use
   [haskell-stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) as
state-of-the-art package manager for Haskell. It will automatically use the
preferred version of `ghc` (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and corresponding versions
of required packages. Otherwise one can use `cabal` on the top of which `stack`
is developed.
 * Once `stack` in installed, clone this repository with `git` (or download it
   manually)
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/maciej-bendkowski/boltzmann-brain.git
 ```
 and enter the folder containing `Setup.hs`.
 Type
 ```
 stack solver
 ```
 If some problems are encountered, add the flag `--update-config`, i.e. type
 ```
 stack solver --update-config
 ```
 This will configure the packages required for your particular system that are
missing. Then consequently type
 ```
 stack build
 stack install
 ```
 This will install `boltzmann-brain` into your system. Type `bb -h` to check
that it works.
 * In order to install the tools for tuning weights of combinatorial systems,
   type
 ```
 pip2 install cvxpy numpy sympy matplotlib
 pip2 install --user paganini
 ```

You can also install `paganini` from sources. Open the paganini folder with the
`setup.py` file and type
```
 python2 setup.py install
```
 
##### Troubleshooting
On `Mac OS` older versions like `10.9` package managers like `brew` can only
install `stack` from source.  This takes a long time. In some cases it is faster
to completely update the operational system before attempting to install some of
the prerequisites.

The `hmatrix` package in `Haskell` requires prominent linear algebra packages
`LAPACK` and `BLAS` (which are sometimes called "one of the achievements of the
human species"). You can follow the instructions on the [official
website](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).

#### Usage

After installing `boltzmann-brain` and `paganini` it is possible to obtain help
about each of the applications by typing
```
bb -h
paganini -h
```

#### Input
The input format mimics that of Haskell algebraic data types where in addition each
constructor may be annotated with an additional *weight* parameter. For instance:

```hs
-- Motzkin trees
MotzkinTree = Leaf
            | Unary MotzkinTree (2)
            | Binary MotzkinTree MotzkinTree.
   ```
In the example, a ```MotzkinTree``` type is defined. It contains three
constructors: a constant ```Leaf``` of weight one (default value if not
annotated), a unary ```Unary``` constructor of weight two and a binary
contructor ```Binary``` of default weight one. The definition ends with an
obligatory dot.

Each definition constitutes an algebraic data type where each inhabitant has an
intrinsic *size*, defined as the sum of all its building constructor weights.
*Boltzmann Brain* automatically detects the input system variant and generates
an efficient singular, rejection-based Boltzmann samplers able to sample
*uniformly random*, with respect to size, inhabitants of the system types.
Though the exact size of the outcome is a random variable, the generated sampler
allows to control the desired lower and upper bounds. 

See the *examples* directory for more examples of supported inputs and
corresponding sampler modules.

#### Features
- easy and intuitive text-based input format;
- automated well-foudness check for the given combinatorial specification (see [3]);
- working, self-contained Haskell module generation utilising ```Control.Monad.Random```
  and ```Control.Monad.Trans.Maybe``` in the implementation of the constructed Boltzmann sampler;
- automated constructor frequency tuning and singularity approximation using *Paganini*;
- support for algebraic and strongly connected regular specifications;
- built-in support for the admissible list-based sequence constructor;
- syntactic sugar for lists and tuples (see below)

```hs
Tree = Node [Tree].
TreeTuple = (Tree, Tree, Tree).
TreeTupleList = [TreeTuple].
```

#### Frequency tuning
*Boltzmann Brain* supports a target frequency calibration using convex
optimisation techniques included in the suplementary *Paganini* script (see the
*paganini* subdirectory). Consider the following example of a specification
defining Motzkin trees with some arbitrary size notion:

```hs
-- Motzkin trees
MotzkinTree = Leaf
            | Unary MotzkinTree (2) [0.3]
            | Binary MotzkinTree MotzkinTree (2).
   ```
Here, the ```Unary``` construct is given weight *2* and a target frequency of
*0.3*. In consequence, the system is to be *tuned* such that the ```Unary```
node contributes, on average, *30%* of the total size of constructed Motzkin
trees.  It is hence possible to distort the natural frequency of each
constructor in the given system. However, such an additional non-trivial tuning
procedure causes a not insignificant change in the underlying Boltzmann
probaility model. In extremal cases, such as for instance requirng *80%* of
internal nodes in plane binary trees, the constructed sampler might be virtually
ineffective due to the sparsity of tuned structures.

#### Annotations
Since v1.3, *Boltzmann brain* provides its own annotation system (see example below):
```hs
-- Motzkin trees

@module    Sampler
@precision 1.0e-12
@maxiter   30

@withIO    y
@withLists y
@withShow  y

M = Leaf | Unary M [0.3] | Binary M M.
 ```
The `@module` annotation controls the name of the generated Haskell module (it
defaults to `Sampler` if not explicitly given).  Next two annotations
`@precision` and `@maxiter` are parameters passed to *Paganini* and control the
quality of the tuning procedure.  If not provided, some default values are
assumed (depending on the detected system type). The last three parameters
control some additional parameters used while generating the sampler code.
Specifically, whether to generate addtional `IO` generators, whether to generate
list samplers for each type in the system, and finally whether to include
`deriving Show` clauses for each type in the system. By default, `@withIO` and
`@withShow` are enabled (to disable them, set them to `n` or `no`); `@withLists`
is by default disabled if not stated otherwise in the input specification.

#### Using Boltzmann Brain with Paganini
Since v1.3, *Boltzmann Brain* automatically calls *Paganini* in order to tune
the sampler corresponding to the given input system. If no special handling is
required, it suffices therefore to have `paganini` available in the system; `bb`
will automatically pass it necessary data and retrieve the tuning vector.

```bb -o Test.hs examples/motzkin.in```

A manual tuning workflow is also supported. To tune a combinatorial specification "by hand",
we start with generating a *Paganini* representation of the system, e.g. using 

```bb -o paganini.pg -s specification.in```.

*Boltzmann Brain* ensures that the input specification is sound and well-founded.
Next, we run 

```paganini -i paganini.pg > bb.param```

which executes *Paganini* and generates a required tuning vector for `bb`.  You
can alter the default agruments of `paganini` scripts like tuning precision,
optimisation problem solver, maximum number of iterations, and explicitly
specify if the type of the grammar is rational (since the optimisation problem
becomes unbounded and the user may receive an error in this case).

 Finally, we need to tell `bb` to use the parameters running, e.g.:

```bb -o Sampler.hs -p bb.param examples/motzkin.in ```
